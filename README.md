This website, named Achievers Lane, is a single-page site designed to promote and manage a tutoring service. It's built with HTML, styled using Tailwind CSS, and uses a small bit of JavaScript to handle mobile navigation.

The site is organized into several distinct, scrollable sections, each serving a specific purpose. Users navigate by clicking links in the header, which smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.

Website Structure and Purpose
Navigation Bar: This is the persistent header at the top of the page. It features the company name and a logo. It contains anchor links that connect directly to each section of the site. On mobile devices, a hamburger menu icon replaces the full navigation bar, which a small JavaScript snippet controls to show or hide the links.

Home Section: The landing page or "hero section" is the first thing visitors see. It features a background image of a student, a bold heading, and a call-to-action button, "Book a Session," that scrolls users down to the contact form.

About Section: This part explains the value proposition of Achievers Lane. It highlights three key benefits: Expert Tutors, a Personalized Approach, and Proven Results, each represented by an icon and a brief description to build trust and credibility.

Subjects Section: This section outlines the tutoring services offered, categorized into subjects like Mathematics, Sciences, Language Arts, and Social Studies. Each category has an image and a list of sub-topics. A button at the bottom of the section allows users to inquire about other subjects, linking them to the contact form.

Tutor Registration: This is a key feature of the site, dedicated to recruiting new tutors. It includes a header and a form for potential tutors to fill out. The form asks for personal information, subjects they can teach, and a description of their experience.

Contact Section: Located at the bottom of the page, this section provides two ways to get in touch. It includes a direct contact form for general inquiries and a separate block with the company's phone number and email address. The forms on both this page and the tutor registration page use a third-party service called Web3Forms to process submissions and send them to the site owner's email.

Footer: The footer contains a social media link (Instagram), which opens in a new tab, and a copyright notice.

The overall design is clean, professional, and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
